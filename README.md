This repo contains the code to learn basic movement to an unblocked position.

## Licenses
We based some of our code on Unities ML-Agent Code: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
In the generic ML-Agents unity classes and the walker-agent class we changed and added code to support our changed agent. Every new peace of code is again licenced with Appache 2.
